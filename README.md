# Solutions for EECS 498/598 : Deep Learning for Computer Vision 2022 Winter

This is my implementation of the assignments for EECS 598 in Winter 2022.

## A few finicky issues need to be noticed :

- The `decoder block` implenmentation for transfomer.py in A5 may result in a high error , which is encoutered by many people . Yet the final accuracy still meets the requirements of this assignment.
- The are some newly added `erratas` for the two_stage_detector.py in A4 , aiming to fix the low accuracy problem , which does not exist in the zip you downloaded from the course website.

## Additionally

The first three assignments are similar each year, while the last three vary with the changes in the course from year to year.

For example , the transformer is added in 2022 winter,and the missing `pytorch_autograd_and_nn.py` is added in A42020fall folder, which would walk you throung the basic usage of autograd and nn.module.
