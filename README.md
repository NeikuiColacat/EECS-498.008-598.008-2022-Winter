# Solutions for EECS 498/598 : Deep Learning for Computer Vision 2022 Winter

This is my implementation of the assignments for EECS 598 in Winter 2022.

A few finicky issues need to be noticed :

- The `decoder block` implenmentation for transfomer.py in A5 may result in a high error , which is encoutered by many people . Yet the final accuracy still meets the requirements of this assignment.
- The are some newly added `erratas` for the two_stage_detector.py in A4 , aiming to fix the low accuracy problem , which does not exist in the zip you downloaded from the course website.
